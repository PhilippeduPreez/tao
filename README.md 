# Patterns 

Our patterns describe the way we operate at Life Itself. They include various practices that we maintain, as well as how we operate internally - e.g. how we are organized, manage projects, get stuff done, and complete issues and tasks. 

Please see here for our [Project Management Guide](/project-management%20/#roles/). 

## Practices

Practicing together is at the core of Life Itself. It helps us foster our community, maintain and live our values and vision, and transmit them in our daily life.
