## 2019 SCQH

### Situation 

Over the last century global population has quadrupled to 8 billion and our world is more complex and intertwined than ever before. Unprecedented technological advance has brought great material wealth, but even the rich are still not truly satisfied, happy and at peace. Furthermore, there is a fear of the future, a lack of visionary hope and we distrust ourselves as a species and our capacity to manage our world wisely, both collectively in relation to challenges such as global warming, and socially in terms of inequality and self-government.

### Complication

There is a growing intuition that something is deeply the matter, that we can be radically weller and wiser personally and collectively than we are today but our current trajectory based on materialism (growth), technology and individualism will not produce that – in fact it presents clear and present dangers both personally in terms of loneliness, acquisitiveness and anomie, and collectively in terms of ecological destruction risking socio-economic collapse or the dangers of runaway technology (e.g. AI).

Achieving a [radically] wiser and weller world requires a breakthrough in individual and collective being. Though simple this is hard to do because we “believe together” and it requires (at least partial) consensus on foundational values and views such as the possibility of transformation (hope), the nature and primacy of (inter)being (rather than the primacy of structure or technology), and an interest and trust in big visions and collective action.

### Question 

What are the foundational values and views and a big vision, and how do we bring forth a culture based on those within our lifetime and the next six generations that is a) radically better than today in its capacity to generate flourishing and fulfilled communities and individuals, not only in that culture but also more broadly; b) engaging in powerful, practical action on collective challenges; and c) pragmatically utopian in its commitment both to being wise itself and in causing a wiser and weller world for everyone.

### Hypothesis

Within our lifetime and six generations hence, we will develop a federation of resilient, flourishing communities based on a shared culture of views, practices and ideals (including the possibility of transformation, the primacy of (inter)being and getting stuff done). These communities will engage with broader society and ally with like-minded groups to foster a culture of wisdom and awakening that can transform society. Finally, these communities will be committed to practical action, which will include contributing to large scale political efforts to address collective challenges.

## 2017 SCQH

In October, we met on the beautiful hills of Tuscany. We reflected on our intuition that something is deeply the matter, and on the need for a big vision as well as practical actions to realize it (including the development of a large-scale political movement).

Here is our SCQH: Situation, Complication, Question, Hypothesis

### Situation

There is a growing intuition that something is deeply the matter, that, despite so much material progress we are not truly satisfied, happy and at peace; there is a fear of the future, a lack of visionary hope and we distrust ourselves as a species and our capacity to manage our world wisely; as the world has become more complex and intertwined it requires patience, rigour, qualitative observation, emotional honesty, deep-thinking, creative application and collective action and very few groups do that.

### Complication

There is a distrust of “big visions”, of any solution that isn’t material or technological; bold and powerful visions of the future are subject to knee-jerk dismissal or destructive debate which prevents their proposal and realisation; we need a breakthrough in individual and collective “being” but a breakthrough here is hard as it requires a consensus on foundational values and views including belief in the possibility of transformation [hope] and the nature and primacy of being.

### Question

What are the foundational values and views, a big vision and its associated roadmap; and how do we facilitate consensus on these and their implementation in the next fifty to two hundred years?

### Hypothesis

Develop a community of people based on a shared culture and shared views that include the possibility of transformation, the primacy of being, getting shit done and [tolerant universalism]; and with a focus on the development of a big vision and committed to powerful, practical action to realise it [including the development of a large-scale political movement] [on the timescale of our lifetimes and those of our children].
