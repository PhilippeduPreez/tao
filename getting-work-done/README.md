# Getting Work Done



## How do we set up projects?

Before project kick-off there is some preparatory work that should be done. Total time required should be no more than a day. However, for larger projects this may take longer. The [Project Owner](https://tao.lifeitself.us/project-management%20/#project-owner) is overall responsible for this stage of the process. 

Preparation usually includes the creation of a Project A10 (see below), of key job stories, as well as ongoing documentation in the Project DB (also below).


### Project A10

The Project A10 serves as a a Project Overview document. 
It is intended to document the project throughout its proposal, initiation, and completion stages. 
This is our [A10 template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q0eslSuhVty6HGxtfgichmryuhBEuFWSvx_aeJvPpi8/edit). 

The proposal stage should include: 

* Key expected outcomes/outputs
* Budget and Ressourcing estimates 
* Team members involved 

Before the project is initiated, the project owner should note: 

* Total Budget
* Aims and Requirements (Purpose, Outcomes and Outputs)
* Project Plan
* Issue tracker
* Risks

These should be continiously updated during the project. 

Finally, once a project has been completed, a retrospective should be filled out, that includes:

* What worked well
* What didn't work 
* Key learnings 


### Key job stories

Project Owner as lead with involvement as appropriate of other relevant personnel
**[2-6h]**

* Generate first set of user stories for this project.
* Do **not** need to be comprehensive -- can add user stories later. However, good to have really core user stories down, and enough to cover, what (at this point), one would anticipate to be at least first 2-3 sprint iterations.
* Cannot over-state the value of generating (good) user stories at this point. Will have a transformative effect on the quality of the project.
* Should involve some or all of delivery team + scrum master, for at least some part of this, because:

  * Gets everyone up to speed
  * Rubber-duck test (have to explain and walk through user stories with others which helps clarify them)
