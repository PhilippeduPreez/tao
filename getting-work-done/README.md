# Getting Work Done



## How do we set up projects?

Before project kick-off there is some preparatory work that should be done. Total time required should be no more than a day. However, for larger projects this may take longer. The [Project Owner](https://tao.lifeitself.us/project-management%20/#project-owner) is overall responsible for this stage of the process. 

Preparation usually includes the creation of a Project A10 (see below) and key job stories, as well as ongoing documentation in the Project DB (also below).


### Project A10

The Project A10 serves as a a Project Overview document. 
It is intended to document the project throughout its proposal, initiation, and completion stages. 
This is our [A10 template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q0eslSuhVty6HGxtfgichmryuhBEuFWSvx_aeJvPpi8/edit). 

Before the project is initiated, the project owner should note:

* Key expected outcomes
* Budget and Ressourcing estimates 
* Team members involved  
* Total Budget
* Aims and Requirements (Purpose, Outcomes and Outputs)
* Project Plan
* Issue tracker
* Risks

These may be continiously updated during the project. 

Finally, once a project has been completed, a retrospective should be filled out, that includes key learnings gained from the project process. 


### Key job stories

The Project Owner, together with other relevant team members, is responsible for generating a first set of user stories for a project.

User stories are generated to gather project-specific requirements. Please read [here](https://playbook.datopian.com/user-stories/#what-is-a-user-story) to know more about what user stories are. 

In general, user stories: 

* Do **not** need to be comprehensive -- you can add more user stories later. However, it is good to have written the core user stories down, and enough to cover, what (at this point), one would anticipate to be at least first 2-3 sprint iterations.
* Will have a transformative effect on the quality of the project. We cannot over-state the value of generating (good) user stories at this point. 
* Should involve some or all of delivery team + scrum master, for at least some part of this, because:

  * Gets everyone up to speed
  * Rubber-duck test (have to explain and walk through user stories with others which helps clarify them)

At Life Itself, we move from user stories to job stories. Job stories give the team more context for the userâ€™s situation and allow them to share their viewpoint and create a solution for what the user wants to do. Job stories are very similar to user stories with one key difference: personas becomes contexts (and jobs).
