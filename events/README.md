# Events Playbook

Intention: we want events to provide a consistent experience of Life Itself that reflects Life Itself brand and values and that others can take on (so we can expand) and that is efficient (we don’t have to generate it again and again).

## Roles

Distinguish production and host (lead) roles:

* Curator: "director" for the event. Set the intention, writes the invitation, lead the event, be present, host people, acknowledgement, relationship with speakers, partners, sets the schedule.
* Producer: logistics lead. Responsible for the event plan, keeping to the schedule, setting meetings, logistics, tech with venue, responsible for guests RSVP;  relationship with venue, caterers
* Temperature checker: if people available, someone to check the ‘temperature’ - the feeling of the room and to notify the host 
* Production support: Helps producer on the day
