# Ad channels

The following is taken from _Julian.com's_ [Growth Marketing Guide](https://www.julian.com/guide/growth/ad-channels).

A _channel_ is a source of user acquisition. 

They can be:

* Paid: ads, sponsorships, and affiliates
* Unpaid: content marketing (SEO), PR, referrals, and sales

The channels a company finds most valuable change as it matures. 

>Companies just launching tend to see the most channel traffic in this order:
>
>* Ads (and/or sales if B2B)
>* Word of mouth and referrals
>* Content marketing
>* PR
>* Everything else
>
>As a healthy company matures, its largest channels tend to re-order as follows:
>
>* Word of mouth and referrals
>* Content marketing
>* Ads
>* Everything else
>

## Channel Fit

You should evaluate which channels will serve your business best. Not all are equal. 

>Use four criteria to prioritize which channels to test:
>
>* Affordability — LinkedIn, for example, is very expensive.
>* Audience fit — B2B services, for example, don't perform well on Snapchat.
>* Audience volume — Is enough of your audience on that channel?
>* Ad fit — Does your product's pitch lend itself to the channel's ad format? (A Snapchat ad looks very different from a Twitter ad.) 
>

## Channel Cost

Every channel has a cost per click (CPC). This is determined by how in-demand a channel's ads are. 

### One time purchases

If you receive one-off payments (if you sell a product, e.g.), then you need to be making at least $15 gross margin per basket. 

>Facebook and Instagram (FB/IG), which are the most reliable ad channels, can't drive e-commerce sales within North America and Western Europe for less than roughly $15. 
>
>You need to be making at least $15 in gross margin per basket. And, you'll of course want to make more to account for volatility — and profit.
>
> FB/IG are the cheapest. Often by a lot. So this $15 floor goes even higher on other channels. If you have low margins, look instead to unpaid channels such as SEO.

### Subscriptions

It's different for subscription services. 

>Here's how to calculate if a channel is affordable for your subscription company:

>* Let's say you're paying $2 per click on your Facebook ads.
>* And that 1.25% of those clicks (i.e. visitors to your site) then purchase your product.
>* So, it costs $160 to acquire a customer. That's your cost per acquisition (CPA).
>* Next, let's say you bill customers $40/mo for your product. And that customers leave after 5 months of use on average. That means you earn $200 per user. That is your average revenue per user (ARPU).
>* Assuming near-zero marginal cost to service a customer, you have $40 of room between what it costs to acquire them and how much they ultimately pay you.
>

### Cost Per Acquisition rule of thumb

>The rule of thumb for healthy, sustainable ad spend is your CPA should be no more than **1/3 to 1/2 your ARPU**. So this example fails the rule — cutting it too close to sustain long-term acquisition. 
>
However, you also need to consider follow-on organic growth, i.e. when your existing customers refer others for free. One way of calculating this is to survey customers (aggressively). 

Also consider your payback period: how long it takes your new customer to repay your costs of acquisition. Quicker the better. 

## Channel costs

The below are approximate for US audiences.

>* LinkedIn — $12-$30 per click, plus audiences don't convert very well post-ad-click
>* Twitter — $4 per click
>* Instagram — $2.50 per click
>* AdWords — $2+ per click, variable per keyword
>* Facebook — $1.25 per click
>* Pinterest — $1 per click, but audiences don't tend to convert well post-ad-click
>* Snapchat — $0.40 per click, but audiences don't tend to convert well post-ad-click

### When you can't afford a channel

Three options for when a channel is too expensive: 

>**Optimize your funnel** — Increase ad and website clickthrough rates. This decreases customer acquisition cost. You can test new ad copy, A/B test landing pages, and introduce coupons.
>
>**Rambo dat shiz** — If you're comfortable temporarily burning cash, you can buy users near-cost to fuel traction. These users constitute the sample needed to A/B test your funnel. And there's a small chance they'll ignite runaway word-of-mouth.
>
>**Abandon the channel** — This is normal. Most channels don't work for most companies. Usually only FB/IG or AdWords work. And nothing else.
>

## Channel niches and expectations

You want the _right_ people clicking on your ads. The greater the fit between your product and your audience, the greater your conversion rate. 

Four factors of audience fit: 

>* **Expectations** — What type of content do users expect to see on the channel? On Instagram, for example, one may expect aspirational photography. On Snapchat, perhaps it's memes. On Facebook, Buzzfeed-style videos. Whatever users' content expectations are, you're bound by them: If your product doesn't lend itself to that content type, it will look even more like an ad. And suffer a low clickthrough rate.
>* **Granularity** — Facebook provides granular control over who you target. Down to people's life events — like who recently had their birthday. In contrast, on reddit, you can only target by people's interests and device types. That's not granular enough to make reddit work for many businesses. Because you're targeting too broadly, which attracts many ill-fitting clicks. And that's expensive.
>* **Demographics** — Distribution of age, gender, location, and lifestyle choices.
>* **Technographics** — Division of mobile versus desktop.
>

FB/IG and Adwords reach everyone. Others are more niche. 
>For your ads to reach scale, you're at the mercy of both your product's market size and that market's targetability across ad channels. 
>

## Channel scale

How much of your audience uses the channel you're testing?



| Channel | No. Users 
| ------- | -------- |
| Facebook   | 2.25bn|
| YouTube  | 1.9bn|
| Instagram | 1bn|
| Twitter | 325mn|
| Pinterest|230mn|
| Linkedin| 125mn|

Low gross margins mean you'll need many customers to generate meaningful revenue. If you product isn't a fit for the channels that feature your hards, you'll struggle to scale. 

### Saturation

When your audience tires of seeing your ads, your ad clickthorugh rate plummets. The smaller your audience, the quicker your saturate it. 

## Adwords, Instagram and Facebook

Start with Adwords and Facebook/Instagram (these two use the same platform). Their massive audiences make them viable for most products. 

## Different Types of Targeting

Avoid demographics who don't want to buy from you (filter by language, geography, gender etc.).

Then, hone in using criteria most likely to engage your users. 

With Facebook, you can target people using the information they include in their profile. 

With Google, you use target words, "keywords", to pinpoint users. 

### Facebook Profile Targeting

>On Facebook, users fill out their profiles that they then enrich by sharing articles and Liking businesses, products, activities, and people.
>
>Users also browse the web at large — visiting thousands of sites containing Facebook's tracking code, which Facebook monitors to infer even more of your interests. Ones you never even expressed on Facebook itself.
>
>You can then roughly target users based off all of this data.
>
>The job of a skilled Facebook advertiser is to determine which of these targetable criteria is most closely associated with their ideal audience. 

### Google Adwords Behaviour Targeting

>Certainly, there's no more direct way to target an ideal customer for a men’s fashion company than to show ads to people searching right now for "men’s clothing."
>
>And that's exactly why AdWords performs so well: People are signaling interest in your product, and it's on you to not drop the ball while pitching yourself.
>
>In contrast, on Facebook, you’re performing profile-targeting: Your audience size is limited by the number of Facebook users who happened to express prior interest that overlaps with your market. And you're merely approximating that overlap. 
>
>Further, Facebook has a timing problem. You may have Liked something related to fashion two years ago — or maybe just this morning. In the eyes of Facebook's targeting capabilities, they're conflated into the same degree of interest.
>
>So you're betting on an audience's current overlap with your product.
>
>In contrast, with Google's search ads, people express their desire to buy a car right now through a query like "buy Toyota vs. Honda". It doesn't get clearer than that.
>
>And people who are interested now are more willing to actually buy — instead of just window shop. This means they're more cost-effective to target. Fewer wasted clicks.
>
>I call search's targeting type **behavior targeting**. As in, someone is performing the behavior of searching for what they want. You then target based on that behavior. This contrasts Facebook's **profile targeting**, which uses profile and past engagement data as a proxy for someone's current interest.


### Behaviour vs profile targeting

Both have their advantages and disadvantages. Optimal strategy is to use them together. 

>Not everyone wanting to buy clothing necessarily searches Google for it.

>If you target exclusively via behavior channels, such as AdWords, many potential customers will never see your ads. Worse yet, potential customers who would actually buy from you but for whom buying is not currently top of mind won't be searching the web at all.

>That's why profile targeting nicely complements AdWords: With profile Facebook, if you can target someone likely to be a good fit for your product, you can bring them up the ladder of product awareness through ad copy and your website. 
>

### Channel targeting and saturation

You can't saturate your market with Adwords. 

>* **Profile saturation** — The downside to profile targeting is having a potentially fixed audience size that tires of your ads: If you target everyone on Facebook who Likes Tom Hanks, that audience isn't getting significantly bigger every month.
> * **Behavior saturation** — With behavior targeting, you can never saturate your market. (You're only bounded by the size of the market.) Because your market is constantly shifting, so it's not the same people who are subject to your ad overexposure. Every moment, it's made up of people currently signaling their entry into the market. Those who are no longer interested don't continue searching.

### Summary of Adwords vs Facebook
Put simply:

>AdWords is better for targeting people who _currently_ want a product like yours, and Facebook is better at targeting people who aren't _necessarily looking_ to buy _now_ but are a _perfect fit_ you could massage into buying your product.

## Ad Channel Summary

>Three ad channel takeaways:
>
>Most channels either won't be home to your target audience or can't be run profitably. Channels that are a fit may have too small an audience for you to meaningfully scale. So test ad channels defensively: Be cautious with your budget, don't beat a dead horse, and double down on what is working.
>
>Finding a way to track follow-on organic purchases may provide the missing data needed to justify continued channel spend.
>
>FB/IG's success is not indicative of AdWords' success. Their users are targeted differently. Use these channels complementarily.

## Best profile targeting channel: Instagram

For many of Julian's clients, Instagram is their only profitable channel. 

>IG users convert the best after clicking ads. And clicks are reasonably priced.
>

**Large audience**: Instagram has more users than Twitter, Linkedin and Pinterest combined. 

**Users are in the right mindset**:

>Users open IG for the purpose of having their attention grabbed by something new. They're open to discovery and distraction.
> 
> What a lovely time to shove an ad in someone's face.
> 
>(In contrast, on Facebook, users are expecting content from _familiar_ friends. So, ads from companies they've never heard stand out like a sore thumb.)

**Factors to consider with Instragram**:

1. Instagram is a good fit for mobile apps and ecommerce. Bad fit for B2B Saas and enterprise companies. 

2. Lots of 18-24 y/o use Instagram and not Facebook, so if targeting this demographic, don't run FB only.

3. Text is buried at the bottom of the ad. Your image must be able to sell the product on its own. 


## Bad Channels summary

* **Twitter**: high costs, poor performance. (However, great brand marketing platform)

* **Reddit**: too niche to be scalable

* **Snapchat**: cheap, but on-site conversion is terrible

* **Display ads**: These are the banners you see across the web. No one clicks on them anymore. Better for brand marketing (staying relevant)

* **Pinterest**: Low conversion due to site configuration ("pins"). Audience 80% female, 60% 24-35. Best for fashion, food, or furniture. 

* **Linkedin**: Very expensive. Works for B2B offering educational and job oppportunities.
