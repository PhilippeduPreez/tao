# Narrative

A stand for life itself

Ordinary people choosing an extra-ordinary path

## Our ambition

A world that is wise, well and awake.

## Why we are here

Being changes everything. Spearhead a waking up, growing up, cleaning up culture. Make politics cool again to address collective challenges. These are key steps to a wiser, weller world for all beings.

## What and How

We build a better, wiser future, now, through culture.

We do this via spaces, a culture and a community – by pioneering our own and by allying with others to transform wider society.

## What makes us different?

Primacy of being. We build infrastructures for awakening. The commitment to commitment. 

The alchemy: of presence and getting sh** done, of the ecosystem and the personal, of Zen and politics, of engaging and retreating.

## Who are we here for? 

The people who want to see a real change and live more wisely, honestly and coherently and have seen that community is essential.

People who go to parties and yearn for deep, meaningful conversation. People who seriously considered becoming monks and nuns or witches but are called to engage with conventional society. The doers dreaming of a bigger future who sense that the inner work is essential.

Ultimately our children, our children’s children and the many generations to come after them. For the ecosystem as a whole.

## What do we value the most?

Mystery, Transformation, Possibility and Joy – and the commitment, practice and discipline to realise them. Zen Activism, Rigorous Inquiry. Doing the washing up.

## What is our personality?

Mystery, joy, iron and earth. We discuss Buddhism and Kim Kardashian. We’re activists who discovered Zen. We’re hippies with discipline. We have macbooks on the farm. We are real more than nice. We are ordinary people who choose an extra-ordinary path.

## The Eight Characteristics 

### Interdependence

You are happy to depend on others, and have them depend on you.

We need to share resources to achieve our aims individually and collectively. This requires a desire and willingness to compromise and go beyond our individual convenience in the service of health and workability of the broader community and vision. Interdependence is not a concept but a lived practice – materially & emotionally. Eg: basic income, revenue sharing to co-ownership. 


### Surplus Making

You support making a surplus and understand that money is essential to our long-term sustainability and impact.

We want to be materially sustainable and independent (over multiple generations). That requires us to make a surplus and we need people who are interested in and/or supportive of making money and creating profitable enterprises.


### Coliving

To nourish and sustain a shared culture we need to spend time together and often this will mean living together.

Coliving brings with it shared practices, fellowship and lived community. It brings direct experience and practice of interdependence, surplus generation and personal and collective transformation. 


### Transformation

We believe that transformation is possible and that this takes training and applied practice.

We expect you to engage in ongoing practice and training to develop ourselves and be well and deal with the stuff that comes up.


### Zen & Mindfulness

Our ontology and philosophy are grounded in Zen and mindfulness. Zen and the practice of mindfulness form the philosophical and ontological ground from which we operate.

Key ideas: you are not your thoughts, be here now, non-attachment to views, enlightenment/nirvana (is possible), non-self, interbeing. Primacy of being aka primacy of the right brain.

_Note: In keeping with Zen tradition, we are eclectic and making Zen into a “truth” that  Zen  attachment to Zen as the truth is itself an obstacle._


### Getting Stuff Done

We ship, we do, we get stuff done.

We’re doers as well as thinkers and meditators. We value hard work, commitment, shipping, and getting sh** done. It takes dedication and effort to be great, to build something big. We want to create extraordinary enterprises and communities – that can not only co-exist with the existing system on its own terms but can surpass it.


### Rigour 

We bring rigour to our practical, intellectual and spiritual endeavours.

We respect expertise and analysis. Not everyone is a Zen master, not everyone is an expert. Science and the scientific method are valuable and powerful. Open-minded critique and examination of beliefs is important. Measurement is crucial to performance (as long as it is not confused with the game).


### Experimental and Creative

You are open to experiment and change.

We don’t have it all worked out. As we explore unknown land we need to embrace uncertainty..
At the same time we don’t deify innovation and change. We are sensibly conservative – and open-mindedly innovative.

Be OK that we are figuring things out (don’t have it all figured out), ok with continuous evolution, artistic / creative, embrace good uncertainty, we are working things out on an ongoing basis.
with innovation and evolution. We are willing to try things out (but we don’t value change for the sake of change or deify innovation).
