What we want to do and **how** we are going to do that.

## Visions

### Long-Term

Within our lifetime and six generations hence, we will develop a federation of resilient, flourishing communities based on a shared culture (views, values and practices including the possibility of transformation, the primacy of (inter)being and getting stuff done). These communities will engage with broader society and ally with like-minded groups to foster a culture of wisdom and awakening [^1] that can transform society and will be committed to practical action, including large scale political efforts to address collective challenges.
 
See the full [SCQH](/scqh/) for context.

[^1]: Shorthand for "waking up, growing up, cleaning up and showing up".

### 30 Year Aspiration

A new way of being (waking up, growing up, cleaning up, showing up) has been sustained materially and psycho-socially over an extended period by a networked community. A community that is acting as:

* A home for transformation for its participants
* A demonstrator to the wider world
* An engine of wider social transformation (see next paragraph)

A new movement dedicated to political and cultural change has emerged based on a worldview aligned with Life Itself's. Policies and platforms have been created and enacted at a local, regional and even national level.

### The Next Five Years (2018)

Over the next 5 years we will continue to grow and share our culture and commitment to practical action by creating and expanding co-living hubs, increasing our outreach, generating more money to expand, and improving our branding. We will begin a big vision conversation about societal transformation which enters mainstream discourse.

More detail is in our [annual plans below](#annual-plans). If you want to know what we've been up to on a monthly basis, check out the updates on our [blog](https://lifeitself.us/blog/).

## How we do it

Our work focuses on two main workstreams or "pillars":

1. **Pioneering a culture**: creating a sustainable network of communities within existing society through hubs and businesses that are pioneering an "awakening" culture -- waking up, cleaning up, growing up (teal) and showing up -- as home, engine and demonstrator
2. **Transforming societies**: Catalysing a big vision conversation to transform the dominant narrative (worldview/paradigm) and associated political and cultural advocacy to enact related social and institutional change.

Pioneering a culture is more local and bottom up. Transforming societies is more societal level and focused on the wider narrative and engagement.

### How do they connect?

At first glance, it may seem these two activities are unrelated. However, we believe they are mutually reinforcing in key ways:
