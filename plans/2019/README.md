# 2019 Plan

**Intention of the year: take the next big leap forward on AET infrastructure of spaces, community and governance.**

## Vision

### Phase I: Infrastructure and Community (2-3yrs)

* Develop the base infrastructure and attract a community.
  * Physical infrastructure e.g. Spaces
  * Social infrastructure e.g. Community
  * Business infrastructure e.g. Datopian

### Phase II: Big Vision and Political Activism

* Refine the big vision, condense and share it. This will include a plan for how to contribute to societal transformation, not just in our community but in broader society.
* Engage in political activism, i.e. a concerted effort to engage the political discourse and action (continued bedding in on infrastructure). By this we donâ€™t necessarily mean traditional politics, but we want our ideas to be taken into the mainstream.

*Note these phases overlap and continue. Infrastructure and community work will continue on an ongoing basis.*
