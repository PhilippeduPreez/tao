## Getting Paid

We have updated our process to make it as smooth and easy and possible. Please find all the information you need in the [Getting Paid Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8ZRmp-VKd1D6RkFUOsYf2GSzI4XksyBjBiXKWfzBH0/edit).

## Expenses and Travel

:::warning
You must submit your expenses as soon as possible, ideally, within 10 working days after the trip. Expenses submitted later than 5 months will not be paid. The same rule applies to non-travel expenses.
:::

If you have any company expenses to be reimbursed for, you should submit them with your monthly invoice for services rendered. Refer to the ["company expenses"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8ZRmp-VKd1D6RkFUOsYf2GSzI4XksyBjBiXKWfzBH0/edit#heading=h.vjm5jslkozc) section of the Getting Paid doc for a step-by-step guide


## Travel Arrangements

All work related travel arrangements MUST be approved by the Accountable person for your project.


## Team, Hours, and Office

### Timezone

The usual timezone we use in Life Itself is aligned with the current standard timezone in UK (unless otherwise agreed within your team).

### Core Hours

Our general working hours are 8am UK â€“ 5pm UK. Not necessarily when you work but when it is permissible to schedule meetings.

### Phone book

You can find team membersâ€™ phone numbers, usernames, phone numbers in [Team Phonebook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B-1PkWZZRrNJZMsfYaJwI07Aq8vtMmFG5cmcZNQ21EY/edit#gid=0).

### Time-off

Remember, weâ€™re not a traditional organization ðŸ˜„ and we operate on self-organizing principles. Thus, time-off is not something approved by your "boss" (who is your boss?). Rather it is something to discuss and negotiate with your peers and anyone else affected.

In short, we ask that you be mindful of our priorities when choosing which days to take off and that you liaise with your colleagues and team, especially with the scrum leader and product owner on the projects you are involved in.

Whilst there are no hard and fast rules we recommend giving reasonable notice, for example for a two week break something like 2 months notice would be recommended.

How to organize time-off:

* Discuss with your team colleagues and especially with the Scrum Master and Product Owner.
* Once agreed, notify office@artearthtech.com to inform them about the dates of your absence and so they can flag if any issues.
* Make sure to add your holiday dates in both the AET Team calendar as well as in your own personal calendar.

### If Youâ€™re Ill

If youâ€™re not feeling well and youâ€™re unable to work, notify your Scrum Master / Product Owner as soon as possible. The notified person will then let teammates know.

Please add an "Out of office" to your calendar and email and include an alternative contact.
