# AET LONDON HUB CO-LIVING AGREEMENT

We are a mindful community seeking to create a sustainable shared space of warmth, getting stuff done, joy, creativity, generosity, acceptance and authentic connection. 

We are committed to living together in a way that cultivates wisdom, compassion and care for ourselves, each other and the world around us.

# Context for the Hub

**Situation**: We – and many others – want to live in a mindful, well, joyful, (affordable) sustainable, hopeful, creative, dynamic, getting stuff done community with a base in London (that would ultimately support children as well) and which would support us in right livelihood, getting stuff done and being well and mindful; many communities fail because they lack shared goals and vision, shared practices and lack tools to do emotional cleaning and deal with conflicts (and/or the capacity to use those tools); and, finally, a flat in London has just been purchased and “rented” to AET for £15k per annum and AET has a plan for a network of rural-city spaces that provide a base for community members, a meeting place to share and build a big vision and be of inspiration to others.

**Complication**: We are not currently living in an (affordable) mindful getting stuff done community, meeting place and people connector in London and we don’t know of one we can join with the right balance of being and doing, requisite rigour and connection with AET’s greater goals;  and AET requires a base in cities like London ( to scale and demonstrate the middle way) and to generate a return on the investment it has received (both to attract future investment and to provide surplus for future investments like expanding the Hub).

**Question**: How can we manage the London space especially in terms of tools, values and rules over the next 18m-3y such that the community running it is sustainable, creative, well, joyful, mindful, getting stuff done; and, that furthers AET’s goal of a wiser world by facilitating like-minded people to connect and align, develop ideas, support each other in taking concrete action in a context of open-mindedness, critical rigour and prioritising quality over quantity. 

**Hypothesis:** Create a hub built around a coliving community and supporting a broader community of members, based on mindful living, critical open-mindedness, integrous workability, getting stuff done, and a sustainable, well-defined, mix of public and private space and time; and that supports its members in connection, ideation and concrete action (in pursuit of a wiser world), and, more broadly, acts as a prototype for further evolution of coliving, co-projecting (incubator) and expansion of the AET nodes.  

# Five Mindfulness Principles

_From Thich Nhat Hanh_

#### Reverence For Life

_Aware of the suffering caused by the destruction of life, I am committed to cultivating the insight of interbeing and compassion and learning ways to protect the lives of people, animals, plants, and minerals. I am determined not to kill, not to let others kill, and not to support any act of killing in the world, in my thinking, or in my way of life. Seeing that harmful actions arise from anger, fear, greed, and intolerance, which in turn come from dualistic and discriminative thinking, I will cultivate openness, non-discrimination, and non-attachment to views in order to transform violence, fanaticism, and dogmatism in myself and in the world._

#### True Happiness

_Aware of the suffering caused by exploitation, social injustice, stealing, and oppression, I am committed to practicing generosity in my thinking, speaking, and acting. I am determined not to steal and not to possess anything that should belong to others; and I will share my time, energy, and material resources with those who are in need. I will practice looking deeply to see that the happiness and suffering of others are not separate from my own happiness and suffering; that true happiness is not possible without understanding and compassion; and that running after wealth, fame, power and sensual pleasures can bring much suffering and despair. I am aware that happiness depends on my mental attitude and not on external conditions, and that I can live happily in the present moment simply by remembering that I already have more than enough conditions to be happy. I am committed to practicing Right Livelihood so that I can help reduce the suffering of living beings on Earth and stop contributing to climate change._

#### True Love

_Aware of the suffering caused by sexual misconduct, I am committed to cultivating responsibility and learning ways to protect the safety and integrity of individuals, couples, families, and society. Knowing that sexual desire is not love, and that sexual activity motivated by craving always harms myself as well as others, I am determined not to engage in sexual relations without true love and a deep, long-term commitment made known to my family and friends. I will do everything in my power to protect children from sexual abuse and to prevent couples and families from being broken by sexual misconduct. Seeing that body and mind are one, I am committed to learning appropriate ways to take care of my sexual energy and cultivating loving kindness, compassion, joy and inclusiveness – which are the four basic elements of true love – for my greater happiness and the greater happiness of others. Practicing true love, we know that we will continue beautifully into the future._

#### Loving Speech and Deep Listening

_Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful speech and the inability to listen to others, I am committed to cultivating loving speech and compassionate listening in order to relieve suffering and to promote reconciliation and peace in myself and among other people, ethnic and religious groups, and nations. Knowing that words can create happiness or suffering, I am committed to speaking truthfully using words that inspire confidence, joy, and hope. When anger is manifesting in me, I am determined not to speak. I will practice mindful breathing and walking in order to recognize and to look deeply into my anger. I know that the roots of anger can be found in my wrong perceptions and lack of understanding of the suffering in myself and in the other person. I will speak and listen in a way that can help myself and the other person to transform suffering and see the way out of difficult situations. I am determined not to spread news that I do not know to be certain and not to utter words that can cause division or discord. I will practice Right Diligence to nourish my capacity for understanding, love, joy, and inclusiveness, and gradually transform anger, violence, and fear that lie deep in my consciousness._

#### Nourishment and Healing

_Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful consumption, I am committed to cultivating good health, both physical and mental, for myself, my family, and my society by practicing mindful eating, drinking, and consuming. I will practice looking deeply into how I consume the Four Kinds of Nutriments, namely edible foods, sense impressions, volition, and consciousness. I am determined not to gamble, or to use alcohol, drugs, or any other products which contain toxins, such as certain websites, electronic games, TV programs, films, magazines, books, and conversations. I will practice coming back to the present moment to be in touch with the refreshing, healing and nourishing elements in me and around me, not letting regrets and sorrow drag me back into the past nor letting anxieties, fear, or craving pull me out of the present moment. I am determined not to try to cover up loneliness, anxiety, or other suffering by losing myself in consumption. I will contemplate interbeing and consume in a way that preserves peace, joy, and well-being in my body and consciousness, and in the collective body and consciousness of my family, my society and the Earth._

# Hub Agreement

_Written in the present tense, as if explaining how the Hub works to a new person._

## Shared Meals

*   Shared meals are an important part of the ‘glue’ that holds our community together. 
*   We share all our food, so anyone can eat anything in the kitchen unless it is clearly labelled otherwise.
*   We are expected to cook supper once a week. Supper is cooked for 7:30pm.
*   We have supper together twice a week (days will be specified in advance and can be adjusted by residents based on consensus).
*   We have breakfast together twice a week.
*   Shared meals are vegan/vegetarian and friendly towards people with other dietary requirements (e.g. gluten free). It is fine for people to supplement their own diet with meat or fish, but this isn’t cooked as part of the main dish.
*   We take it in turns to wash up communal meals. If you cooked, you don’t have to wash up. We aim to cook a fairly large amount, ideally so that there are leftovers for people coming home late or for lunch the next day.

## Collective Responsibility

*   We take collective responsibility for the care of the Hub, and try to keep it tidy for each other. For example, when we finish in the kitchen, we try to wash up the things we have used.
*   As the communal part of the Hub will be used intensively we understand that keeping things clean and tidy, putting things away after us, washing up after us and not leaving things lying around in the main space is a priority for our well-being and harmonious on going relationship. The aspiration is to leave the Hub communal spaces cleaner than you found them.
*   The expectation is that everyone will do the following things each week:
    *   Cook dinner once (or twice if working in a pair)
    *   Wash up dinner once (or twice if working in a pair)
    *   Be present for the majority of Hub meetings
*   We have a cleaning rota, and each week one person is responsible for a deep clean of the communal spaces (kitchen, living room, bathroom, toilet, corridor) including hoovering, cleaning all surfaces in bathroom and kitchen etc.
*   Any time put into the Hub in addition to the above is freely given. For example, if some of us choose to work on the garden, spend time hosting guests, or bake a cake, we take care not to feel resentment towards anyone who is not choosing to do this, or believe that they are somehow ‘not doing their fair share’.
*   Guests who are staying for more than three days or more are expected to help out with the cooking, cleaning and washing up (on a pro-rata basis).
*   The Hub is quiet after 11pm and before 7am.

## Communicating & Resolving Conflicts

*   “Getting complete”, emotional “cleaning” and conflict resolution is a priority in our community.
*   We believe that unspoken resentment and unresolved disagreements cause blocked relationships that damage a community.
*   We seek to create safe spaces for each other and to learn tools such as meditation, integrity (restoration), flower watering (acknowledgement), non-violent communication and sharing to help us transform conflict into positive growth.
*   We are determined to show-up to each other, not hide from things for convenience, when we have a chance to address issues in a sufficiently safe and kind space. 
*   We do a practice like “beginning anew” at least once a month prior to or just after a communal meal (the first communal meal of the month).

## Practicalities

### Money & Shared Resources

Guests will be advised whether they are part of the shared cost of communal food or just expected to replace what they use and contribute to the food from a place of generosity. 

 This applies only if the guest joins the shared communal food:

*   We share the following items which are paid for communally: cleaning supplies, washing powder, basic bathroom supplies, bills and food. This comes to a total of about £XX per person per month. We aim to live in a spirit of trust and friendship and generosity, and keep things simple, so we all pay the same amount.
*   Note that shared food excludes meals out, takeaways and alcohol.
*   We aim to buy organic and fairtrade food, and ecological cleaning supplies where possible. We aim to purchase bulk supplies from a cooperative wholesaler such as Suma, where possible.
*   Items are paid for from each of our own finances and then the cost is reimbursed by Hubmates. We use a simple online tool to keep track of how much we owe each other. (We aim to not be more than £100 in debt to other Hubmates at any time.)

### Sex & Relationships

*   Sex in individual bedrooms only, not in communal spaces.
*   All genders and orientations are welcome.
*   Free to bring partners to Hub, with the intention of being respectful to Hubmates and atmosphere. We’d like it if you felt comfortable enough to be able to introduce them to Hubmates.

### Alcohol & Other

*   Alcohol is ok in the Hub, to be consumed responsibly so that people are still able to be aware and sensitive towards others.
*   Care should be taken to not disrupt the mindful atmosphere of the Hub
*   Where possible, we aim to let the group know what we are up to, so that we can have open-communication, take care of each other and know what to do in emergencies
 
### HUB Space

*   The Hub is intended to act as a space for a wider community as well as the Hub residents. We intend to be welcoming and inviting to others, and be generous-spirited to others being in the space.
*   As with any issues within the resident community it is important that we voice promptly anything that is not working for us so that it can get resolved.
*   We intend to use the spaces in our Hub to occasionally host groups from the wider community (e.g. mindfulness or community groups). While only some of us may be involved in organising a particular group, we all intend to be welcoming to the space being used in this way occasionally.
*   Hub dinners have an optional donation or bring a dish.
