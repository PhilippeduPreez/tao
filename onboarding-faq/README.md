### How should I report on my work / progress? 

We use Gitlab Issues to track our work. You should create an issue for any assignment, or project, that has more than one actionable step, and you should lay your issue out as follows:

```md
## Job Story
## Acceptance Criteria
## Tasks
## Analysis
```

E.g.

```md
## Job Story
I want to create an FAQ for new recruits, accessible from the Onboarding guide, so they have access to useful information that will make the joining process as smooth as possible. 

## Acceptance: 
* [ ] An FAQ section at the end of the Onboarding Guide with answers to the questions below. 

## Tasks: 
* [ ] Write answers to the following questions:
   1. How do I write an issue?
   2. How do I set/plan my work?
   3. How should I report on my work / progress?
   4. Who's my 'boss'? Who am I accountable to?
   5. Outside of my work responsibilities, do I have other commitments / things to attend?
   6. What's my work responsibilities?
   7. What's your culture? What makes you unique?
   8. How do you get stuff done? 
   9. How do your projects get initiated? 
   10.How does your budget get set?

## Analysis

None for this issue. Here you might include your questions and hypotheses, or other contextual information relevant to your issue. 
```

Once you’ve set out your issue like this, you should keep it up to date so that your team members can follow along. 
* First, ensure that it is labelled correctly. You can label issues so that issues with the same label appear together in your Issue Board on Gitlab. This makes reviewing outstanding issues easier.

* Then, make comments next to each task, **in bold**, to indicate how you’re progressing with each task. This should be done so that somebody else can see, at a glance, how you’re getting on. 

* Third, you should keep a log of your progress in the Comments section of the Issue. The difference between writing updates in the description and in the comments section is that the Comments section represents the _flow_ of your work, whereas the Description represents the most up-to-date _state_ of your work. You should ensure you use both. 

* If you need someone else to assist you, you can @ them in the Comments section with a message to indicate what you’d like their help with. However, ensure you’ve generated a hypothesis first, and that you include it in your message. This way, you might find you can solve it yourself, and if you can’t, it helps your team follow your thought process. 

* If you are blocked, i.e. you cannot make progress without a response from a team member, label your issue as ‘Blocked’ and ensure the relevant person has been @’d in the comments so they are aware you require their assistance.

* Finally, once you’ve completed your issue, you can label the issue as ‘In review’ if it needs a team member to look over it, or you can close the issue altogether. You must include a brief comment explaining why the issue has been closed. You should start your comment with one of the following:

  * FIXED
  * INVALID
  * WONTFIX
  * DUPLICATE. 

* And follow it up with a short explanation of why the issue has been closed. Read a [more detailed explanation](https://playbook.datopian.com/issues-tasks/#closing-issues) in the Datopian playbook.

### How do I set/plan my work? 

If you’re looking for guidance on how to track your progress as you work, please see the FAQ above. If you’d like to know what to do if you’re looking for something to do, this will be answered here. 

If you’re stuck for something to do, there are a few places to look. You could ask your team on Discord or Whatsapp if they have any tasks/issues that they could assign to you. You could look through existing issues in your projects on Gitlab, and take over any that aren’t assigned. You could create your own issue to solve a problem that you’ve identified, but which hasn’t yet been addressed. Or perhaps there’s something in the collaborative inbox that needs actioning. 

In terms of how you go about doing your work, you have the freedom to choose a work pattern that suits you best, so long as it’s consonant with the needs of your team. Remember to be conscious of your team’s priorities when assigning yourself issues, as it’s generally the case that some issues are less pressing than others. 


### Outside of my work responsibilities, do I have other commitments/things to attend? 

Life Itself runs events throughout the year that you’ll be invited to attend, and your presence, while not mandatory, would be welcome!


### What are my work responsibilities? 

Job descriptions at Life Itself are intentionally wide in scope. This allows you to find work within the company that suits your interests, skills, and motivations. Life Itselfers are flexible workers, and tend to go where their energies are needed most. If you’re really stuck on what you ought to be doing, don’t hesitate to bring this up with your team. 


### Who's my 'boss'? Who am I accountable to? 

Life Itself doesn’t employ a conventional management pyramid. While Rufus and Sylvie “run” the ship, team members are entrusted to do their work without supervision from “higher-ups”. See below for more information.


### What's your culture? What makes you unique? 

Teams at Life Itself are self-organising. We trust each other to get our work done, and we have the freedom to do it our own way (within reason). You won’t have management “checking up” on you. You’re accountable to your team, and it’s your responsibility to ensure that you’re keeping your word. We think this sets us apart from conventional work environments. Add to that that we’re 100% remote, asynchronous, and distributed, i.e. we work from different places, at different times, using our own computers: it all makes for an entirely different way of working. We prioritise explicit and clear communication, and take extra care in tracking our progress so that we don’t miss or duplicate work. We check in with each other daily to catch up and see if anyone has any blockers we can help with. And finally, when we ask you how you are, we actually mean it!


### How do you get stuff done?  

Please familiarise yourself with the Getting Things Done methodology: [https://rufuspollock.com/2019/05/27/getting-things-done/](https://rufuspollock.com/2019/05/27/getting-things-done/)

Pay particular attention to the importance of capture. If you are assigned a responsibility, team mates shouldn’t have to prompt you or ask twice for you to get it done. If you’re unclear about an assignment, ask for clarification (but make sure you’ve formulated a hypothesis first!).


### What’s a hypothesis? 

Hypothesis refers to two things at Life Itself. The first is a web annotating tool, called Hypothesis, that we use to note comments and improvements to websites. You should be familiar with this from your onboarding. 

The second refers to a way of problem solving that begins with a question, and then, before you ask the question, leads to a hypothesis about what the answer might be. In doing this, you’re building the muscle of finding the answers to your own problems first. Of course, if you’re still in need of assistance, you should ask the relevant team member. But make sure when you ask questions, you always present the hypothesis at the same time.

E.g.

We need to pay an invoice on Xero. How should we do this?
**Hypothesis:** My hypothesis is that the answer is in the ops guide. I'll find out. 


### How do your projects get initiated?  

Typically by creating a Gitlab issue. See above.
