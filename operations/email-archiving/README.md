# How to archive emails

##### The process

When you send operations or spaces-related emails internally, generally it's a good idea to CC one of the collective inboxes, so that the whole team is kept abreast of the issue. 

##### Internal Email

If your communication is _internal_, i.e. not to someone without a lifeitself.us email address, then you can CC _spaces-team@lifeitself.us_. 

##### External Email

If your communication is _external_, or involves one or more parties without a lifeitself.us email address, then you can CC/BCC spaces@lifeitself.us. 

##### Archiving 

If you want to simply archive a message or its thread, you can use either crm@lifeitself.us or spaces@lifeitself.us.
