# Offboarding 

When somone leaves their role with Life Itself, they write a Handover guide. This guide details their role and responsibilities, so that any future team member can pick up from they left off. This task is for the team member to complete themselves.
  
For remaining Life Itself staff, the following tasks must be carried out. These are generally removing the team member’s access to the websites and software used by Life Itself:
  
* Xero - Remove team member as user from Xero. Only Rufus has admin access to do this. 
* Github - Remove team member’s access to the Life Itself group on Github.
* Google workspace - Delete team member workspace account, as this costs money. (Who has access to this?)
* Wordpress - Remove team member’s access to the Life Itself wordpress.
* Additionally, the offboarder should ensure they have scheduled an exit interview with the departing team member before their final day. Ideally, the exit interview will take place some time (for example a month) after their departure to give time for reflection, but it may be easier to schedule it in their final week. The template exit interview guide is here, and this should be sent to the interviewee at least a week before their interview to give them time to consider their answers: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uk64hDpywfElPgsKIsNEx0ksaLOa53fViOQkcrgVNqI/edit?usp=sharing
