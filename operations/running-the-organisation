## Getting Paid

We have updated our process to make it as smooth and easy and possible. Please find all the information you need in the [Getting Paid Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8ZRmp-VKd1D6RkFUOsYf2GSzI4XksyBjBiXKWfzBH0/edit?usp=sharing).

Additionally, you can refer to the [step-by-step process & FAQs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Iu4olEU3McaY5c_5PwAPqeAgQ6qmLoXS/view?usp=sharing).

## Expenses and Travel

::: 
You must submit your expenses from the business trip as soon as possible, ideally, within 10 working days after the trip. Expenses submitted later than 5 months will not be paid. The same rule applies to non-travel expenses.
:::

If you have any company expenses to be reimbursed for, you should submit them with your monthly invoice for services rendered. 
- Refer to the ["company expenses"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8ZRmp-VKd1D6RkFUOsYf2GSzI4XksyBjBiXKWfzBH0/edit#heading=h.vjm5jslkozc) section of the Getting Paid doc for a step-by-step guide


## Travel Arrangements

All business-related travel arrangements must be approved by a member of the Leadership team.

- The first thing to do is research the flights and the accommodation you want to book according to the budget agreed with your project manager.
- Send an email with the links to Office Requests and CC office@artearthtech.com.
- Remember to include all information needed for the booking:
preferences in terms of flights and accommodation (late check-ins, breakfast, window seats, pre-order cabs, etc.).
- Full name, birth date, phone number; airline miles account number if you are using a frequent flier programme.
- The ops team will book the requested hotel & flight and forward the confirmations to you.
- Note: Remember to store all receipts from the trip or else they can’t get reimbursed. See Expenses and Travel section.

## Team, Hours, and Office

### Timezone

The usual timezone we use in Life Itself is aligned with the current standard timezone in UK (unless otherwise agreed within your team).

### Core Hours

Our general working hours are 8am UK – 5pm UK. Not necessarily when you work but when it is permissible to schedule meetings.

### Phone book

You can find team members’ phone numbers, usernames, phone numbers in [Team Phonebook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B-1PkWZZRrNJZMsfYaJwI07Aq8vtMmFG5cmcZNQ21EY/edit#gid=0).

### Time-off

Remember, we’re not a traditional organization and we practice self-management and self-organizing. Thus, time-off is not something approved by your “boss” (who is your boss?). Rather it is something to discuss and negotiate with your peers and overall resourcing coordination team as they are the ones affected.

In short, we ask that you be mindful of business priorities when choosing which days to take off and that you liaise with your colleagues and team, especially with the scrum master and product owner on any projects you are involved in.

Whilst there are no hard and fast rules we recommend giving reasonable notice, for example for a two week break something like 2 months notice in would be recommended.

How to organize time-off:

Discuss with your project team(s) and especially with the Scrum Master and Product Owner.
Once agreed notify office@artearthtech.com to inform them about the dates of your absence and so they can flag if any issues.
Make sure to add your holiday dates in both the AET Team calendar as well as in your own personal calendar.

### If You’re Ill

If you’re not feeling well and you’re unable to work, notify your Scrum Master / Product Owner as soon as possible. The notified person will then let teammates know.

Please add an “Out of office” and include an alternative contact.
