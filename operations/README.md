##### Explanation of key dates

| Date | What | Where |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1st January | Start of accounting period
| 31st December| End of accounting period
| 30th September | File annual accounts | Companies House
1st October   | Pay corporation tax bill| HMRC
| 29th November | File confirmation statement | Companies House
| 31st December | File corporation tax return | HMRC

_NB: We file at Companies House and HMRC together._ 

Every year, Life Itself makes up its annual accounts for the period 1st January to 31st December. This is an account of how much money has been received, how much money has been spent (collectively referred to as the "Profit and Loss" or P&L for short), and how many assets and liabilites the company has on hand at the end of the year (the "Balance Sheet"). An asset might be a piece of property, a car, or the cash sitting in the bank, while a liability might be any outstanding creditors (people/firms who are owed money by the company) such as a mortgage.

_See here for a more detailed explanation of [assets and liabilities](https://digit.business/financial-literacy/what-is-an-asset-what-is-a-liability). Read more about how we [prepare our accounts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rSLj081NKkWPkR0Ys3ZVTy0tkFEr3pcJ-W86ajhchbg/edit#heading=h.wb79i011u16d) and how to do so [using Xero](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rSLj081NKkWPkR0Ys3ZVTy0tkFEr3pcJ-W86ajhchbg/edit#heading=h.q9ko728rlch4)._

Accounts are filed with Companies House each year at the latest 9 months after the end of the accounting period (in our case 31st December), so for us our Companies House deadline is 30th September. 

In addition, we file a confirmation statement by 29th November each year, which ensures the information HMRC holds about Life Itself is up-to-date. 

Furthermore, we have to pay our corporation tax bill by 1st OCtober each year, 9 months and one day after the end of the accounting period, and we have to file our corporation tax return by 31st December every year for the previous accounting period.  The tax return is our account of how much corporation tax we owe, and must be filed no later than 365 days after the end of the accounting period.
