# Initiatives
 
Our intention is to bring about cultural and political transformation and to create a society that embodies our values of wisdom, well-being and awakening. We aim to achieve this by sharing the culture of Life Itself and by bringing a big vision conversation about social transformation into the mainstream.
 
## Our Work
 
* **Calls:** Our online calls provide participants with virtual spaces for personal growth and transformation. Through our calls we share the culture and practices of Life Itself, creating a supportive community committed to personal transformation. https://lifeitself.us/calls/
 
* **Wiser:** We write and curate information on how to cultivate a wiser way of living and deliver these ideas to our subscribers. Our content is tailored to support readers who want to contribute to solving the greatest crises facing our species and the planet. https://lifeitself.us/wiser/
 
* **Cultural Development Coaching:** We offer cultural development coaching to organisations and businesses, using our practices and learnings to develop wise and well work cultures.
 
* **Hubs:** Our hubs are micro-cultures which embody [the values of Life Itself]. The hubs provide communal environments that support the well-being and self-growth of their residents and foster links with local communities through events, workshops and co-working spaces. The hubs provide a focal point for those interested in societal change and transformation to meet, discuss and collaborate. You can read more about the culture of our hubs in the [Residency Agreement](/hubs/agreement/) and you can find images and application forms for living in our hubs on our website. https://lifeitself.us/hubs/
 
* **Life Itself Institute:** The Life Itself Institute carries out research into how we can create societies that are wise and well. By producing and sharing research, we aim to provide guidance on the practices, values and policies that can transform society and also foster a big vision discussion about social transformation which enters mainstream discourse. https://lifeitself.us/institute/
 
* **The Gathering:** The Gathering is a yearly retreat for participants from a wide variety of backgrounds who all share a commitment to creating a wise, well society for the future. We meet to connect, discuss, experiment, meditate and reflect; to explore what it would mean to build a better future. https://lifeitself.us/gathering/
 
* **Possibility Now:** Possibility Now is an initiative started by Life Itself to spark hope for social change and foster an open-minded, imaginative, collective conversation about how society can be transformed for the better. https://possibilitynow.org/
 
* **Contemplative Activism:** Collective Activism is an initiative started by Life Itself to explore how we can bring contemplative awareness, skills and practices into activism and social leadership. Wisdom and awakening will be increasingly important if we are to successfully respond and adapt to the deepening ecological crisis we are facing. https://lifeitself.us/activism/is
 
## Associated Organisations and Initiatives
 
We are committed to building links with other initiatives and organisations with which we are aligned. This means both establishing companies that embody a wise, well work culture and partnering with pre-existing organisations working on social transformation.

* **Untitled:** Life Itself is currently curating events for the Untitled Imaginary Society Forum, a monthly online forum dedicated to fostering imaginative exploration of the social futures we can create. https://untitled.community
