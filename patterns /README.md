# Patterns 

Our patterns describe the way we operate at Life Itself. They include various practices that we maintain, as well as how we operate internally - e.g. how we are organized, manage projects, and get stuff done.  

Please see here for our [Project Management Guide](/project-management%20/#roles/) and [how we get work done](). 

## Practices

Practicing together is at the core of Life Itself. It helps us foster our community, maintain and live our values and vision, and transmit them in our daily life.
