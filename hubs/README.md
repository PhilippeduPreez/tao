# Being a Hub Member 

## About The Hubs

Hubs are central to Life Itself's mission to create a weller, wiser world. Hubs house members of the Life Itself community, and create a welcoming space to live and be, to share and connect. 

Life Itself currently has two hubs: Berlin and Bergerac. Visit our website to [discover more about our hubs](https://lifeitself.us/hubs/). 

## Agreement

The [Residents' Agreement](https://tao.lifeitself.us/hubs/agreement/) applies to both long-term residents and guests.

## Our Principles and Practices

Some of the most important principles and practices that we maintain to foster a community are [Beginning Anew](/beginning-anew/), [Five Mindfulness Trainings][5mt], and [Five Remembrances](/five-remembrances/).

### Community

From the [Life Itself manifesto](https://lifeitself.us/manifesto/):

>_A community for people seeking a wiser world_
>
>Though living in societies which have never been so rich our sense of purpose and connection is often missing. A growing number of us are seeking lives that are meaningful as well as productive yet we struggle to find a balance, finding ourselves trapped in conflict.
>
>With Life Itself we want to offer a way to combine wiser and weller ways of living whilst remaining engaged in conventional society.
>
>Our approach focuses on fostering a community of people seeking a wiser world. We do this by providing space, a network and knowledge: 
>* Space in the form of physical places that can act as homes for our community members to work, meet and stay. 
>* Network in the form of gatherings that bring the community together to reflect, learn and connect. 
>* Knowledge in the form of education and research to develop and share ideas, approaches and best practices.
>
>We are practical and natural. We connect the ancient and the modern. Our interests ranges from nature to neuroscience, Dada to data. We seek harmony and balance: art and techne, earth and spirit, science and wisdom, freedom and discipline, mindfulness and intention.
