# Hubs

## Introduction

Hubs are central to Life Itself's mission to create a weller, wiser world. Hubs house members of the Life Itself community, and create a welcoming space to live and be, to share and connect. 

Life Itself currently has two hubs: Berlin and Bergerac. Visit our website to [discover more about our hubs](https://lifeitself.us/hubs/). 

<!-- TODO: have info on "why" hubs, and their context within life itself ... -->

## Frequently Asked Questions

### The following FAQs are addressed explicitly in the [Residents' Agreement](https://tao.lifeitself.us/hubs/agreement/):

* What's shared/common and what's private? 
* What time do we spend together? 
* Can I eat meat? Can I drink alcohol?

### Who do I talk to if I have a question?

Every hub has a dedicated manager whom you will be able to contact with any queries. 

### How are hubs run? 

In the hubs, we make many decisions collectively. In doing so, we respect each other, maintain our [principles](https://tao.lifeitself.us/principles/) and [resolve conflicts](https://tao.lifeitself.us/hubs/agreement/#communicating-resolving-conflicts) with integrity, determined to transform conflicts into positive growth.
