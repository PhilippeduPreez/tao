## Job stories ...

### Engaging

#### Understand vision and strategy

When engaging with Life Itself I want to understand quickly what they do and what their aims are so that I can work out if they are compatible

* This should obviously be our main website. However i think there is often more, or more detailed information we can put in the Tao (e.g. website should be more focused on offer "outwards" i.e. what do people visiting us want. Whereas Tao can give more info on what we are up to in deep sense that might be out of place on the website)
