## How to Read the Way

*Or ... The Truth Believed is a Lie. Live the Way, do not Follow It.*

The wise enshrine the miraculous bones of the ancients within themselves. That is, they apply it as far as possible to themselves and their situations, vivifying the way of wisdom with their own bodies and lives, not just in their thoughts. They do not regard the teachings of the way as an external body of knowledge or information to be possessed as an acquisition or believed or revered as inflexible dogma.

Moreover, there is no fixed teaching. Nevertheless the real wisdom, the teaching of the awakening ones, is of one uniform flavor, that of liberation. Just as many rivers lead to the ocean, where their different flavours share the unifying taste of of salt, so do the teachings of wisdom flow together into the ocean of awakening and become one with liberation.[^1]

# About

We’re pragmatic utopians. We are committed to practical action for a radically wiser, weller world. We create [coliving hubs][hubs], start [businesses][], do [research][] and engage in [activism][] to pioneer a wiser culture.

Find out more about

* Who we are: https://lifeitself.us/people/ and who we work with: https://lifeitself.us/collaborators/
* How do we make money: our hubs fund themselves through resident's rent, and surplus for investment comes from our businesses and winning grants.
* Our vision: a world that is wise, well and awake. See [visions](https://tao.lifeitself.us/plans/#visions) for our short-, medium- and long-term visions. 
* Why we do it: our culture, grounded in materialism, technology and individualism, doesn’t lead to wellbeing and limits our ability to address collective problems. We believe we need to change our culture: the views, values, beliefs, practices that underlie our collective way of being. And to do this we need to live or work together hence creating co-living spaces and businesses; and spread ideas through writing and events, ultimately creating a political movement. [Longer version: see our reason for the existence of Life Itself (SCQH)][scqh]
* How it fits together: TODO diagram.
* How we will achieve it: Being changes everything. We will spearhead a waking up, growing up, cleaning up culture. We want to make politics cool again to address collective challenges. These are key steps to a wiser, weller world for all beings. Read about our [Plans](/plans/). 
* How we started and how we got here: see https://lifeitself.us/about/story/
* What have you done recently: please see https://lifeitself.us/blog/
