# Welcome

Welcome to our community. We’re pragmatic utopians, committed to practical action for a radically wiser, weller world. We create [coliving hubs](https://lifeitself.us/hubs/), start [businesses](https://lifeitself.us/businesses/), do [research](https://lifeitself.us/institute/) and engage in [activism](https://lifeitself.us/activism/) to pioneer a wiser culture.

## How to Read the Way

*Or ... The Truth Believed is a Lie. Live the Way, do not Follow It.*

The wise enshrine the miraculous bones of the ancients within themselves. That is, they apply it as far as possible to themselves and their situations, vivifying the way of wisdom with their own bodies and lives, not just in their thoughts. They do not regard the teachings of the way as an external body of knowledge or information to be possessed as an acquisition or believed or revered as inflexible dogma.

Moreover, there is no fixed teaching. Nevertheless the real wisdom, the teaching of the awakening ones, is of one uniform flavor, that of liberation. Just as many rivers lead to the ocean, where their different flavours share the unifying taste of of salt, so do the teachings of wisdom flow together into the ocean of awakening and become one with liberation.[^1]

* **Who are Life Itself?** Read about [our team](https://lifeitself.us/people/), [who we work with](https://lifeitself.us/collaborators/) and [our history](https://lifeitself.us/about/story/). 
* **How do you make money?** Our hubs fund themselves through residents' rent, and surplus for investment comes from our businesses and winning grants.
* **What is your vision?** A world that is wise, well and awake. See [visions](https://tao.lifeitself.us/plans/#visions) for our short-, medium- and long-term visions.
* **Why are you pursuing your vision?** The culture of Western society, grounded in materialism, technology and individualism, doesn’t lead to wellbeing and limits our ability to address collective problems. To change society we need to change our culture: the views, values, beliefs and practices that underlie our collective way of being. These are key steps to a wiser, weller world for all beings. To read more, see our [reasons for the existence of Life Itself](/scqh/).
* **How will you achieve your vision?** We are creating co-living spaces and businesses that embody our values and sharing our ideas through research and events, with the ultimate aim of creating a big vision conversation and a political movement.
