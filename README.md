## How to Read the Way

*Or ... The Truth Believed is a Lie. Live the Way, do not Follow It.*

The wise enshrine the miraculous bones of the ancients within themselves; that is, they do not regard teachings of the way as an external body of knowledge or information to be possessed as an acquisition or believed or revered as inflexible dogma, but rather apply it as far as possible to themselves and their situations, vivifying the way of wisdom with their own bodies and lives, not just in their thoughts.

Moreover, there is no fixed teaching. Nevertheless the real wisdom, the teaching of the awakening ones, is of one uniform flavor, that of liberation. Just as many rivers lead to the ocean, where their their different flavours share the unifying taste of of salt, so do the teachings of wisdom flow together into the ocean of awakening and become one with liberation.[^1]
