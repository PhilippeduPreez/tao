## How to Read the Way

*Or ... The Truth Believed is a Lie. Live the Way, do not Follow It.*

There is no fixed teaching. Nevertheless the real wisdom, the teaching of the awakening ones, is of one uniform flavor, the flavor of liberation. Just as many streams lead to the ocean, where their flavours are subsumed in the taste of salt so do the teachings of wisdom flow together into the ocean of awakening and become one with liberation.

When this essence is lost, and people enshrine relics of past method for a sense of personal satisfaction, righteousness, or comfort, then it is said that the medicine has become a disease. It is our practice to cut through all ploys of egoism in all its guises, “holy” or “profane,” to break up stultifying material and intellectual idolatry.

The wise enshrine the miraculous bones of the ancients within themselves; that is, they do not regard teachings of the way as an external body of knowledge or information to be possessed as an acquisition or believed or revered as inflexible dogma, but rather apply it as far as possible to themselves and their situations, vivifying the way of wisdom with their own bodies and lives, not just in their thoughts.[^1]
