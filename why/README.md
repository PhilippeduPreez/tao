# Context for the Hub

**Situation**: We – and many others – want to live in a mindful, well, joyful, [affordable] sustainable, hopeful, creative, dynamic, getting stuff done community with a base in Berlin [that would ultimately support children as well] and which would support us in right livelihood, getting stuff done and being well and mindful; many communities fail because they lack shared goals and vision, shared practices and lack tools to do emotional cleaning and deal with conflicts (and/or the capacity to use those tools); and, finally, a flat in Berlin has just been rented to AET and AET has a plan for a network of rural-city spaces that provide a base for community members, a meeting place to share and build a big vision and be of inspiration to others.

**Complication**: We are not currently living in an [affordable] mindful getting stuff done community, meeting place and people connector in Berlin and we don’t know of one we can join with the right balance of being and doing, requisite rigour and connection with [AET’s] greater goals;  and AET requires a base in cities like Berlin ( to scale and demonstrate the middle way) and to generate a return on the investment it has received (both to attract future investment and to provide surplus for future investments like expanding the Hub).

**Question**: How can we manage the Berlin space especially in terms of tools, values and rules over the next 18m-3y such that the community running it is sustainable, creative, well, joyful, mindful, getting stuff done; and, that furthers AET’s goal of a wiser world by facilitating like-minded people to connect and align, develop ideas, support each other in taking concrete action in a context of open-mindedness, critical rigour and prioritising quality over quantity. 

**Hypothesis**: Create a hub built around a coliving community and supporting a broader community of members, based on mindful living, critical open-mindedness, integrous workability, getting stuff done, and a sustainable, well-defined, mix of public and private space and time; and that supports its members in connection, ideation and concrete action [in pursuit of a wiser world], and, more broadly, acts as a prototype for further evolution of coliving, co-projecting (incubator) and expansion of the AET nodes.
